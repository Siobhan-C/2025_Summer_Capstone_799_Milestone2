#### Week 9 Notebook – Predicting Early Mortgage Delinquency
This notebook shows my Week 9 review of the Home Credit dataset as part of my capstone project on predicting early mortgage delinquency. This notebook uses gradient boosting on the Home Credit Default Risk dataset, tuning learning rate, number of estimators, tree depth, and regularization parameters to improve model performance and support early delinquency prediction for my capstone project in mortgage lending.
